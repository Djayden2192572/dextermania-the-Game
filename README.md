# Dextermania: The Game

My second unity game based around dexter. It's about dexter's rise to the top to save rita as he meets all kinds of wacky characters.
This project took ten weeks.

# Things to note:
The jump physics demand dexter's center to be on something before being able to jump.
In the event of someone falling in the final level they should reset the game, due to time constraints i haven't been able to add a death plane.
Due to time constraints i wasn't able to make the timer stop when you reach the top.
Every level has a theme around a character and platforms and the like are based around that character, so when you see something out of place you shouldn't trust it....
